# Etch-a-Sketch

This project contains an Etch-a-Sketch webpage that will allow the user to draw inside a grid of squares that can be resized by the user. This project is being written as an assingment for the Odin Project. By the end of this project I will have a better understanding of DOM manipulation.

Here is a [live preview](https://mmrupard.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/) of the Etch-a-Sketch.
